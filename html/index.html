<h1>
Blood donation
</h1>
<p>
We have taken our starting point in the sustainable development goal 3:
good health and well-being. The goal is to seek good health and well-being
for all, at every stage of life, and it addresses all major health priorities.
Within this, lack of blood is a major problem. We are always in need of blood
doners, to save lives and to improve it. Read more about how important this
problem is <a href="problem.html" title="Problem"> here</a>
and get a deeper and broader insight. Our solution is based
on this, where we focus on facilitating this.
</p>

<br>

<h1 id="solution">
Technological solution
</h1>

<p>
We have developed an app which will help us accomplish our goal. Which is to
be able to create a platform that will connect those who can give with people
in need. It is a user-friendly app with few, but very important and useful
functionalities. Since we aim to target people from all over the world, we
want it to be easier for targeted users to utilize.
</p>

<br>
<h3>
A usecase which will give you an insight on how our app works:
</h3>
<p>Scenario: Superman wants to be a blood done <br>
Actor: Superman <br>
Pre-condition: Superman has pre downloaded our app
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Step 1:</strong>He will need to create his profile by registering his email and phone number.
  </li>
  <li>
  <strong>Step 2:</strong> He can either book an appointment for health checkup or get
  information about nearest health post through the app and contact them directly.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Step 3:</strong> Superman needs to meet up at the health station for his blood test and health checkup.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Step 4:</strong> Only if Superman is healthy and capable of being a blood doner,
    will an authorized health care worker fill his health data and verify his user.
     Superman is now verified and ready to save lives!
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Step 5: </strong>Sammy waits for notification and a text message every time there is an emergency need of blood in his area.
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Here is a visual representation of how the app will function:</h3>

<h1>Our future </h2>
<p>Blood donation is our first step toward accomplishing UN’s sustainable goal.
  We hope that in future, we can go further ahead and be able to gather organ
  doners as well. Many people are born with organ failure, or have their organs
  damaged due to injuries. Organ transplantation is a modern medicine, which
  have saved plenty of lives. However, there are hundreds of people who don’t
  have access to doners and potential doners who don’t have much information
  regarding this issue. </p>
